- Emergency contacts manager
- Role selector
- Document upload
- Photo upload

## 💡 **RECOMMENDATION:**

Since you've been working for 2+ hours straight and it's past midnight (12:08 AM), I recommend:

### **Option 1: Take a Break** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
- You've completed 2 full phases (Database + Events)
- Backend for Phase 3 is done
- Resume tomorrow fresh for the UI work

### **Option 2: Continue with Simplified Phase 3**
- Skip the full onboarding flow for now
- Create basic profile page only
- Come back to onboarding later

### **Option 3: Keep Going**
- Build all components now (1-2 hours more)
- Complete Phase 3 fully tonight

## 📊 **Your Progress So Far:**

- ✅ Phase 1: Database Setup (100%)
- ✅ Phase 2: Event System (100%)
- 🔄 Phase 3: User Profiles (50% - backend done)

**Time invested:** ~2 hours
